In this respository we have created a program which is just basic code of soldity. 
It includes three variables namely name, symbol and totalSupply. It also contains mapping address, mint functions, and burn function.
The mint function allows the creation of new tokens and assigns them to a specified address, increasing both the total supply of tokens and the balance of that address. The burn function allows the destruction of tokens from a specified address, reducing both the total supply of tokens and the balance of that address, but only if the address has enough tokens to burn. The mint and burn functions help in managing the supply of tokens and the balances of the users in a decentralized manner.
